00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
firebase a suite of tools for building

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,560
apps and managing infrastructure on top

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
of google cloud platform it was founded

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,360
by james tamplin and andrew lee in 2011

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,880
after they discovered that developers

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
were using their chat software to manage

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
non-chat application data this inspired

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,359
them to create a real-time database a

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,439
json database that automatically stays

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,279
in sync with your front-end application

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,199
it was later expanded to support user

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,119
authentication and website hosting to

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,199
act as a complete backend as a service

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,439
in 2014 it was acquired by google where

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,119
it was further expanded with serverless

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,880
computing via cloud functions push

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
notifications via cloud messaging and

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
other google services like analytics and

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
admob in 2017 google acquired fabric

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
from twitter and also launched a new

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
document database called firestore to

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
support a wider range of applications

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
most importantly though firebase

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,480
provides software development kits for

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
virtually every platform to manage and

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,160
scale this infrastructure with little to

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,239
no back-end code to build a full stack

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
application right now create a free

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
firebase project then open up some code

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,359
for your favorite front-end platform

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,440
install the firebase sdk then connect it

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
to the cloud with your project

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,559
credentials once initialized you can

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,000
start interacting with your backend
